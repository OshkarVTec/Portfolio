    body: "This is a 2D collaborative game, developed by me and my teammate, which is inspired by the Hollow Knight game. The objective is to capture the 3 masks that appear on top of the map. The first player moves the character and has the ability to transform it through the movement of an accelerometer connected to an FPGA Arty board. The second player uses the mouse to create platforms that the character uses to reach the masks. There is a 7-segment display attached to the Arty, which displays the current score. There are 4 LED indicators on the Arty, which show the state of the movement (left, right, still) on red, and the transformation on green.",

    body: "I worked on a project to develop an MP3 music player with a graphical interface using Python. The goal was to simulate the entertainment interface of a car with a display screen. The project was implemented on a Raspberry Pi4 and included a connection with an Arduino to read user inputs from buttons. Through this project, I gained experience programming with consideration for hardware and embedded systems. It was an exciting opportunity to work on a project that involved both software and hardware development, and it helped me to develop my problem-solving and critical thinking skills.",
